Bixt (through bixt.net service) replaces keywords or keyword phrases with affiliate links that you define per keyword.

== Description ==

The plugin uses Bixt.net which is a free web service that allows you to monetize your site or blog by converting selected keywords or keyword phrases into affiliate links.
You can use the same settings on multiple sites. You will need to configure the plugin (enter your User ID and a domain name) and the plugin will automatically insert the necessary
JavaScript snippet into your page and you are done.

All you need to do next is write articles that include the keywords that you've defined at Bixt service and almost all the phrases will be replaced with the affiliate links via JavaScript.
You can manage keywords from one single central area: <a href="http://bixt.net/?utm_source=bixt&utm_medium=plugin-readme&utm_campaign=product" title="affiliate marketing tool, affiliates, skimwords" target="_blank">bixt.net</a>

= Benefits / Features =
* Manage all your affiliate links from one central location
* You can use the same JavaScript snippet on any site not just WordPress powered ones (e.g. blogger, or even static sites).
* Asynchronous JavaScript loading which means that it will not slow down the page loading/rendering
* Easy to install and use
* Keyword phrase search is case *insensitive*
* Install and forget
* and the best part *absolutely and totally Free*
* Note: You define keywords and we don't override or add ours!
