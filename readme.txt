Bixt replaces keywords or keyword phrases with affiliate links that you define per keyword.

== Description ==

Bixt.net is a web service that allows you to monetize your site or blog by converting selected keywords or keyword phrases into affiliate links.
You will need to configure the plugin (enter your User ID and a domain name) and the plugin will automatically insert the necessary
JavaScript snippet into your page and you are done.

All you need to do next is write articles and include talk about products and the selected keywords will be replaced with an affiliate link.

You can manage keywords from one single central area: <a href="http://bixt.net/?utm_source=bixt&utm_medium=plugin-readme&utm_campaign=product" title="affiliate marketing tool, affiliates, skimwords" target="_blank">bixt.net</a>

= Benefits / Features =

* Manage all your affiliate links from one central location
* You can use the same JavaScript snippet on any site not just WordPress powered ones (e.g. blogger, or even static sites).
* Asynchronous JavaScript loading which means that it will not slow down the page loading/rendering
* Easy to install
